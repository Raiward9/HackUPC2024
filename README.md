# HackUPC2024
The following project was created during the HackUPC 2024 hackathon to the TravelPerk challenge. 
This project aims to arrange meaningful events between users. In order to do it, we collect the data of one user through the interface implemented with Taipy. The data is used to look for events through the API of Ticketmaster with related categories and it is also used to retrieve the users from the dataset with matching preferences.
#Installation
